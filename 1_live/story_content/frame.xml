slideid="6BfUNqhNdmJ.6E2bdrazLfZ" slidebank="false">advice example the trifocal principle  advice approach every design consideration from three perspectives simultaneously, with special attention to their integration: from how the structural level of consideration draws upon a system resource level, and, at the same time, feeds into a functional level. learning to jump from level to level, reflexively and consistently, is essential to successful design thinking. problem people often think about design, or a design problem, primarily in terms of structure, i.e., to focus primarily on the elements that copattern (tend to appear together). the problem with this approach is that it creates a limited understanding of design. it ignores two other, interrelated perspectives of design: what the structure draws upon (systems of design resources open for selection and combination) and why the structure is being created in the first place (namely, to carry out a function, to do something for someone in some context). goal to approach design (and all design practices and decisions) structurally, systemically, and functionally, integrating all three core perspectives. solution  advice example solution  solution for any given design structure, identify its parts (the elements that copattern - i.e. show up together) - and note that these elements exist at the same level of logical type. ask what the structure does (function). clarification of function will equally answer the question: why put these parts together this way? note that function resides one level of logical type higher than the structures that feed into it. ask what system resources (systems of choices open for selection) are required to build up the structure. system resources are equally the answer to the question: how do we make one of these? note that the system resources reside one level down from the structures that they feed into. considerations nothing is a system or a structure or a function in its own right.  rather these words designate three different, but interrelated, perspectives which we can use to describe units - primarily via their relationships to other units. any unit can be viewed as, or described by, any of these three terms, depending on how we position them relative to what we’re attending to (namely, what we’re considering). for example, we can consider a launch screen as a structure: it has parts that come together in a typical way. but from another perspective, it is equally a system resource in relation to higher levels: say, the whole app (i.e., it is merely one of many subsystems that feed into the overall function of the structure we call the app). and yet from a third perspective, the launch screen provides the context and functional requirements for other, lower-level units such as buttons, text, search windows, etc.  note, too, that the three perspectives align with the three levels required to establish a design pattern. this is not a coincidence. in order to say something a pattern of any type, we need to describe what is being related or brought together (structure), what it does (function), and what we would need to build it (system).   advice example  example on the right are two versions  (a and b) of homepages for master[ed].  as designers, we constantly had to consider our design choices from three levels simultaneously, hence the term, “trifocal perspective”: a structural level (what things appear with what other things); a system resource level (what things can we draw upon to build up, or make, the structure); and a functional level (what kinds of things must the structure do in order for the whole design to succeed). solution </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6BfUNqhNdmJ.6gLKIdtD9Tg" slidebank="false">advice example the de copia principle  advice use principles of divergence to multiply system resources to generate, and then to access, the maximum number of units open for selection and, therefore, to produce the widest range of possibilities available for building up a structure.  problem starting a project without considering all the constitutive options can lead to underdeveloped or inadequately resourced structures. taking full inventory of available resources can help address this problem.  this principle is named after a famous work by the humanist scholar, erasmus, who wrote a treaty called copia: foundations of the abundant style, which served as a rhetorical guide, outlining methods to give variety to speech and writing (multiplying system resources). in chapter 33 of this work, he famously uses divergence to generate almost 200 variations on the phrase “your letter pleased me greatly” (erasmus 514). goal to provide the widest range of units open for selection. solution  advice example solution  solution apply various divergent techniques to the pattern to generate the maximum number of units open for selection: mind mapping - a visual diagramming process used to organize related units and topics by connecting related units with lines.   brain storming - a creative tool that aims to generate units by requiring individuals or groups to defer judgement and aim for quantity over quality. random input - a creativity tool that uses random sensory input to help individuals generate a wider range of units. click here for more examples of divergent techniques.  considerations it is easy to generate more resources than can be utilized in a single design. the opposite of divergence, then, is convergence: the ranking of options, which then combined to form a functional output. in our case, we wanted to include choices that exhibited at least one point of strategic differentiation (something of value that is different than competing products). in the end we decided on a combination of text, image, and audio based on the functional requirements (desiderata) because there were apps that did one, but not all three, of these inputs.  we would like to have included video as well. however, we discovered that the size of video files - and the cost of providing server space - failed to meet the functional requirements at the higher, business level: to provide a low cost solution to our end users.   advice example  example in the initial stages of imagining master[ed], we needed to determine what type of inputs to implement (for example: audio, video, text, images, doodles, external files etc.). to accomplish this, we used divergent techniques (many of which resemble structured brain storming processes) to generate a list of as many potential inputs as possible. specifically, we mapped out as many inputs as we could think of that supported the platform (namely an iphone). solution </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6BfUNqhNdmJ.5cpKwnW9esT" slidebank="false">advice example the principle of register  advice as a designer, avoid inventing designs from scratch without checking to see if there are already established design patterns (registers) in circulation. registers not only save the designer time, they also set the interpretive and evaluative framework by which designees (i.e., design audiences) understand and judge a design. there may be good reasons for your design to depart from a register, but if it does, it must do so strategically (namely, by feeding into a function at a higher level; e.g., an atypical interface structure may help a company brand themselves as “innovative” with respect to their competitors). problem designers often forget that, although the structures they are creating display some degree of uniqueness, the high level functional exigencies that they are addressing are generally relatively common. this means that other designers have probably faced similar contextual exigencies, requiring structures to carry out similar functional requirements, and consequently over time, a register has developed.  goal to spend less time trying to reinvent the wheel. make sure that if you depart from a register, you do so strategically rather than mistakenly. solution  advice example solution  solution begin by understanding the existing register. surprisingly few situations are entirely novel. what are the accepted best practices for the situation you are facing?  establish the costs and benefits of departing from the established register. if you depart too far from the register, you risk the audience not understanding the design at all. however, if you depart from a register successfully, the audience may view your design as innovative.  considerations if a company has branded itself as adding value by being innovative, it will need to push the boundaries of the register (more often than not, successfully) to maintain this value proposition. following a register means adapting your content to established and expected patterns - it is not the same a merely copying a design (pastiche).   advice example  example once we had established that master[ed] would primarily use text-based annotation, we had a number of structural decisions to make. one of the most challenging structures to design was the interface to add new tags to a project. we had to decide between following the established register, which in this case meant a ‘+’ button in the top left corner, or departing from the register and using a different ui element. in our case, our initial designs departed from the register, employing a pull-down gesture instead of a ‘+’ button. solution </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6BfUNqhNdmJ.664cowLjRiB" slidebank="false">advice example the delta principle  advice track a design change (delta) across an entire metapattern, ensuring that you consider the potential consequences of a design choice at each level.  to test our design choices, and therefore, to understand their impact across various levels, both above and below, by introducing a change at one level to see how it resets the likelihood that something will change at other levels. this resetting of likelihood is the basis of meaning (bateson 46, 47). if increasing a font size, for example, has no effect on legibility or readability or the user experience or the target market, etc., then we can say the change does not meaningfully redound at those levels. problem anthony giddens discusses the role of unintended consequences and unacknowledged conditions on society in terms of what he referred to as “structuration,” (giddens 5). namely, it is difficult to predict the effect of a delta across complex systems (in this case, design metapatterns) as they propagate through those systems over time (which i will refer to as an “internal” delta). equally, designs often have unacknowledged conditions, or put another way, there are always broader contexts whose impact on a design can’t always be known fully or in advance (which i will refer to as an “external” delta).  goal to test the meaningfulness of a change - as well as to verify the relationships constituting a metapattern - we can introduce a delta and track its effects, internally and externally. solution  advice example solution  solution actively track external deltas. these deal with factors generally not directly in our power to control. monitor the impact that broad contexts and new material resources may have on your design. actively tack internal deltas. these deal with factors generally thought to fall within the power of designers to control. iteratively test your design ideas by introducing incremental and isolated changes and following what patterns they reset at other levels of logical type. note that it’s best not to change more than one thing at a time if you want to test that delta specifically. attempt too many changes at once and you won’t know which of the many changes produced which result. considerations if a delta has no effect, then it introduced a difference that didn’t make a difference to a user in a context, or as bateson would say, it contains no information (223). this can happen either because the unit changed wasn’t patterned with other units under consideration or because the change wasn’t significant (e.g., changing a rgb colour value by one increment).   advice example  example - external near the launch date for master[ed] we noticed that apple had just launched a service called mastered for itunes (meant to give artists the ability to remaster their music for aac mp3 compression). this is an external turn of events (change in our marketing and business context) that we could not have anticipated when we named our product master[ed], but that has made search engine optimization (seo) and brand recognition much more difficult for our company. these new contextual pressures may require us to change our name (an internal delta). it is important that we evaluate the effect of a different name on our brand value proposition and our target markets, and at all other lower levels as the delta cascades down the metapattern. solution </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6BfUNqhNdmJ.6cOOjzXljPt" slidebank="false">advice example the threshold principle  advice set the upper (control) and lower (constraint) bounds of a metapattern to meet the functional needs of the relevant community - bearing in mind that where these thresholds are drawn has real-world consequences.  problem how do we set the lower and upper levels of units under consideration? specifically, how material or abstract should the units be that a designer considers when designing, or when communicating about design? for example, does a typographer need to consider everything from typefaces to advertising layouts? or from ink to target markets? or from the protons of carbon atoms to the arc of 21st century hypercapitalism? setting the threshold on how the range of patterns that can be patterned together is important: it establishes what is inside and outside consideration by a knowledge community (kuijpers 1). goal to set the metapattern thresholds appropriately so that communication about your design will be understood and accepted by your stakeholders and audiences. solution  advice example solution  solution in theory there are no limits to the levels that can be patterned together in any design. however, this is not the case in practice. practically, every design reaches a point where additional levels of constraint or control are no longer relevant to the community that employs them. to find these threshold conditions: take note of the highest and lowest level in the metapattern. ask yourself “why this level, and not a level (or higher) lower?" when the answer to 2 is “because that doesn’t make a difference to designers” (or any other relevant discipline), you have hit a threshold. for example, although the molecular structure of a particular ink is technically a system resource for printing, typesetters do not normally draw upon it. the concept of thresholds can be difficult for integrators, who are multidisciplinary in their thinking and often attempt to create increasingly expansive metapatterns. however, practically speaking, there will always be threshold conditions governing the upper and lower limits of a metapattern.  considerations there is rarely consensus about the exact thresholds accepted by a knowledge community (for example, “pure” or “applied” are distinctions disciplines often use to mark a different understanding of threshold conditions). to make matters even more complicated, where the thresholds are drawn has a large impact on the trajectory of a design (e.g. since design conflicts are resolved to meet the needs of the highest contextual level, expanding or restricting the number of contextual layers up for consideration will change the criteria for design decisions).   advice example  example when completing ethics forms to conduct user experience research for our app master[ed] on the university of waterloo campus, i encountered an interesting question: what are the potential benefits of your research to society? we hadn’t considered any functional levels above the business context of master[ed]. it simply was not a context that we to justify the significance of a choice in our design. answering the question exposed the nature of thresholds - simply put, social benefits were not a difference that made a difference to us at that stage of design. solution </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6BfUNqhNdmJ.5e1FemRPXdf" slidebank="false">advice example the keep-it-straight principle  advice integrators need to keep things straight, not conflating units at levels that need to be kept separate, nor differentiating units that are at the same level. design is more likely to succeed, or succeed faster, if the practice of patterning up units is not confused. problem as metapatterning chains become large, with multiple functional contexts and many copatterning structures, it can be easy to mislabel, misalign, or omit the relationships among the units constituting the chain. many issues can arise from confusing levels of logical type: conflation (treating units at different levels as if they are of the same type) and omission (leaving out levels when tracking deltas). goal to help integrators avoid the two most common types of metapatterning errors: level conflation; level omission. solution  advice example solution  solution check copatterning structures by ensuring that no structure is a part of, attribute of, or context for, another structure at the same level. check the metapatterning chain to ensure that no intermediate levels are omitted. considerations be aware that any time you place two things in opposition (as in, we can either have a or b) you are putting a and b at the same level of logical type. anthony wilden calls this process "symmetrisization" (wilden, man woman 25). as mentioned in point 1, it is especially important to check the units you have placed in opposition to ensure they are not a part of, attribute of, or context for, one another.   advice example  example most designers are familiar with the problems associated with scope creep (i.e. adding more and more features in the hope of appealing to a larger audience). however, under closer analysis, we can see that scope creep is an example of omitting intermediate levels. scope creep occurs when we connect the interface (which structures the features of the design) directly with the business context (make more profit by appealing to more markets), passing over user experience (ux) as an intermediate level. once we include ux concerns, we can see that adding features has a cost (generally, the more features the harder to find the one you want, according to hick’s law ) and that these costs add up, leading potentially to a bad user experience. giving more people more choices won’t necessarily create more demand for the design (at the level of business). many of the most common design principles have been developed to help designers address this type of missing level of consideration (fitt’s law, hick’s law etc.). solution </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6BfUNqhNdmJ.6Sabfh9taDe" slidebank="false">advice example the desiderata principle  advice identify and understand the multiple contexts exerting functional pressure on all levels of your design. this pressure introduces convergence to the design process: namely, the activity of bringing together units in order to create something capable of carrying out one or more functions. designs are multi-contextual, with the higher levels of context setting the functional requirements downwards.  to ensure your design meets its functional goals, resolve any design conflicts (competing design choices) in favour of the next highest levels of context. problem given all the options open to selection, how does an integrator know which one(s) to choose and then combine into a structure? how does an integrator establish the criteria for selection and therefore the motivation for convergence? note the word “desiderata” refers to what is desirable, which is normally a functional requirement expressed as a criterion of choice. goal to formulate the functional selection criteria that will achieve the overall goal of the design. solution  advice example solution  solution establish which contexts are at play and at which levels. establish what functional pressure is being exerted by these contexts (convergence). understand how this pressure can be stated as desiderata (what is desirable). understand which lower level resources the desiderata points to for selection, given the functional exigencies of higher levels. ask, if there are conflicts between different levels of functionality, how can we resolve the tension in favour of the highest levels first? considerations the desiderata principle exposes why it is necessary to create one primary persona. as stated in point 5, if there are conflicts between different levels of function, we need to resolve the tension in favour of the highest level first. if all personas are at the same level of logical type, we would be unable to resolve this tension.   advice example  example once we had established a list of all the possible inputs for master[ed], we needed to develop a criteria of selection based on the needs of our persona. not all choices would be equally effective at higher levels of logical type. for instance, although video might address a potential user desire, it would require many technical solutions (a system resource in this case) that would be very costly to develop (a tension at the functional business level). in keeping with the desiderata principle, we resolved this tension in favour of the higher level of logical type and decided not to implement video. however, in some cases investing in a technical innovation would allow the company to be much more profitable in the long term. in recognition of this dilemma, we also had to state that for the time being, when we talk about the level of business, we are looking to be profitable as soon as possible (which requires choosing the inputs that have the lowest bar to profit). this insight became part of the desiderata that we applied to further research and development. solution </slidetext><slidetext

function integration logical type metapattern pattern practice redundancy/          copatterning master[ed]  units at lower levels of logical type provide the material resources for building up functional structures. in this way, lower levels constrain what it is possible to build at higher levels. constraint  all the broader systems and structures in which a particular structure carries out its function (lemke 166; stillar 52-53). following the trifocal principle, every level can be viewed as drawing upon the system resources of lower levels and feeding into the functionality of higher levels. higher levels contextualize lower ones by exerting “functional pressure,” or desiderata, on what needs to be selected and combined at lower levels in order for a structure to do what it needs to do. context  units at higher levels of logical type provide the motivations and/or reasons for what resources need to be selected and how they should be combined. in this way, higher levels control what gets built, such that the sub-structures below emerge to support higher level ones. control  function tim brown describes convergent thought as "a particular way of deciding among existing alternatives," (66). put into metapatterning terms, convergence is about patterning up an appropriate structure out of system resources by applying functional desiderata.  convergence system  structures resources  the name for the change of state, over time, of a unit at any level. internal deltas are the changes that designers introduce as part of their normal practice: trial and error to get desired results. external deltas are the changes that designers introduce to respond to contextual or material factors outside of their control.  delta  a term describing the pressure that contexts exert to select particular system resources and to combine them into particular structures in order to carry out a desired function or functions. as the term suggests, it expresses the criteria of desirability governing how structures converge to accomplish higher level functions. desiderata  for the purposes of this primer, design will be considered an instance of a meaning-making system in that it is both the process and the output of building up structures by drawing upon systems of resources that can carry out multiple functions across multiple levels of context, patterned to fit with, or sometimes play off, already established patterns, or registers (stillar 107). design  a process or method for multiplying system resources to create more possibilities for selection (brown 67). this may take the form of brain storming, mind mapping, or other techniques created to help designers generate many difference system resources open to selection. see brown, 82 for more examples of divergent exercises.  divergence  what a structure does. function can be successful or not, depending on the properties of the structure, and the conditions set by the context. note that the same structure might have more than one function, and equally, may feed into functions at different levels of logical type (stillar 21).  function  a theoretical and practical body of knowledge concerned with why and how knowers pattern up patterns - both within and between fields of inquiry - into new structures capable of carrying out progressively higher-levels of functionality across broader contexts of situation. knowledge integration (ki) is the name for an emerging discipline whose area of study rests one level of logical type above those disciplines whose theories and practices it seeks to integrate. as a meta-discipline, ki explores what needs to be the case in order for integration to be possible, knowable, and beneficial.  integration  based on wittgenstein’s concept that the name of class cannot itself be a member of the class it names: they are at different levels of logical type (wilden, system and structure 250). equally, the level that a structure contributes resources to is higher than itself, and conversely, the level that it draws resources from is lower than itself in logical type (wilden, man and woman 16-21). note: the lower the level of logical type, the more material the units are, which establishes feasibility (do we have the resources to make this thing, or to make this outcome happen?). the higher the level, the more abstract the units are, which establishes desirability (what is the significance, value, or goal of the unit under consideration?). logical type  integration designers have to pattern up patterns, both from within the discipline of design  and from across a variety of other, related disciplines (borchers 3). this activity will be referred to as "metapatterning." by definition, patterns combine three metaredundant levels (n-1 // n /// n+1); therefore, a metapattern combines multiple patterns and makes metaradundant their attendant metaredundancies (lemke 168-169). each of the three levels on the right is itself a pattern and therefore contains metaredundant relationships.  metapattern ux marketing ui (ui //  ux /// marketing)  a pattern brings together units across three interrelated levels of logical type: n-1, n, n+1. these levels are metaredundant: "metaredundancy is just a way of describing how the redundancy, the predictable relation or connection between two things, can itself be redundant (i.e. have a predictable connection) with something else. this is redundancy of redundancy, or metaredundancy," (lemke 169). pattern n n + 1 n - 1  the greek word, praxis, refers to putting ideas to work. in terms of design and integration, practice involves the act of making selections from resources and then combining them into functional structures. theory and practice are two poles along the same axis: seeing patterns (theory) and patterning up things 1. based on what we see and 2. to give ourselves new things to look at and consider (practice). practice  the likelihood that two units at the same of logical type will show up together (redound), given their mutual metaredundant relationship to various contexts (at higher levels) (lemke 168, 169). because we can predict something about which units will be found together given our knowledge of their shared context, the units show redundancy: the same way that we know u is likely to follow q if the context is the english language. a copatterning relationship is denoted with a single slash (as opposed to multiple slashes which indicate levels of metaredundancy).   copatterning  someone who moves back and forth along the theory and practice axis by asking questions about (and seeing new theoretical relationships among) patterns, and then answering those questions and putting those insight to work by engaging in material practices (schön 69). for a reflexive practitioner, theory provides insight into, and guidance for, practices; practices , in turn, provide a “renewal of connection” for theory, to ensure that it can account for lived activities, events, outcomes, and changes in the world. reflexive practitioner  register is a general structuring of resources that can carry out typical functions in a recurring situation of use (stillar 54). it is a pattern that emerges over time, and circulates widely, and is akin to the concept of “genre.” because these patterns are both typical and pervasive, they “register” with people, and become the basis for audience expectation and evaluation. register  anything that is built up, made, constructed. when i refer to structures, i am attending to its parts: namely, the various elements found at the same level of logical type and that copattern together (wilden, system and structure 242). structure  an ordered array of mutually exclusive possibilities, all of which are open for selection, such that the selection of one possibility produces a different “outcome,” or effect, than that of another. (stillar 14; lemke 84, 85) system  the greek word, theoria, means “to see.” a theory lets us see relationships, patterns, connections in a way that allows us to explain phenomena or predict outcomes. to do so, a theory should be illuminative and generative: illuminative, to allow us to identify how things are structured (the basis of analysis) and what those structures should do (the basis of critique); and generative, to allow us to produce something, whether that be objects, insights, explanations, or predictions. theory  short for “unit of consideration,” meaning anything that we’re attending to at the moment, as if it were a single, independent entity (unus meaning “one” in latin). unit is the same as structure, but considered outside (or independent of) the other terms related to structure, as specified by the trifocal principle: system, function, context, etc. we use “unit” when we want to invoke a unifocal, rather than trifocal perspective, on whatever is being thought or talked about.  we do so because talking about something in terms of three different but interrelated perspectives can be cumbersome, and there are occasions when we want to talk about something “as if it were one thing” even though it is always implicated in a complex of multi-leveled relations.  unit  in the spring of 2012, i began leading a team of undergraduate students in the research entrepreneurs accelerating prosperity program (reap). we created a mobile app we called master[ed], which allows the user to annotate an audio recording with short text and image tags to facilitate an efficient review process.  to download master[ed] for ios, follow this link. master[ed] </slidetext><slidetext slideid="5nvQubasEeN.5qlx1CH2m7A" slidebank="false">why did we develop master[ed]? the design project what grounded our design decisions for the app? what were the main challenges in designing its interface?  what were the main challenges in designing its user experience? what were the challenges with marketing and business strategies? the idea for master[ed] came out of functional need of the reap program to capture and disseminate the ideas generated in its lab. reap is a research initiative affiliated with the university of waterloo and several local private-sector partners, which fosters student entrepreneurship. initially i worked on a project developing group ideation techniques (which we called "thinkering") to explore potential technology mash-ups and applications in our lab.  however, after each hour and a half thinkering session the only lasting results were short 2-3 minute presentations and the rough creative work the teams left behind. we needed a way to record the creative outputs and share them coherently with people who didn't attend. we began prototyping a system we called the "idea jar" where people could share their ideas in a speaker's corner style booth. but we didn't just want to capture what people considered their best ideas, we wanted to have a record of the entire process. we needed something at every table, recording the whole creative dialog. however, even with only 5 groups and an hour and a half event, that is still 7.5 hours of audio or video to review. we needed a way to facilitate an efficient review process as well.  this is why we created master[ed]. by using smartphones we could supply one to every table, use existing hardware to capture audio-visual information, and use a touch interface to allow participants to "tag" (create short text descriptions) while they worked - allowing us to review the process more efficiently.    why did we develop master[ed]? the design project what grounded our design decisions for the app? what were the main challenges in designing its interface?  what were the main challenges in designing its user experience? what were the challenges with marketing and business strategies? click to enlarge as with most design projects, our design decisions were grounded in a persona. although master[ed] was originally conceptualized for use in a lab, we have gone through many iterations, exploring different potential markets. in the end, we are focusing on undergraduate students as our primary persona.  as discussed in the primer, we began to understand how a persona can be understood as the desiderata for design decisions. for this reason, we decided to focus on one primary persona, acknowledging that other personas may exist, but that they are secondary i.e. at a lower level of logical type. any additions to a design to meet the needs of secondary personas can only be made if they are not in conflict with the primary persona.  master[ed] had a number of secondary personas, including a ux researcher, a wedding planner, and a journalist.    why did we develop master[ed]? the design project what grounded our design decisions for the app? what were the main challenges in designing its interface?  what were the main challenges in designing its user experience? what were the challenges with marketing and business strategies? what inputs to capture? one of the first challenges we encountered designing master[ed] was what inputs to capture. smartphones allow you to capture many different types of data; from video, to audio, to text, to location, etc. given the large number of system resources we had to draw upon, we used the persona to develop desiderata and make more informed decisions. however, some of our decisions also came out of iterative testing. for example, the first versions of master[ed] allowed users to tag video. however, having to hold the device perpendicular to the floor and type on it simultaneously was not ergonomic, and produced shaky video.  how to resolve the novelty vs. familiarity tradeoff? as pointed out in the primer, there are benefits and drawbacks to creating designs that do not conform to the existing registers. some of our ipad user interface (ui) designs in particular had uis that were nonstandard. when we moved to iphone development, we were more mindful of the established register, primarily because of the new constraint of limited screen size. as shown in the images on the right, we found ourselves iterating more towards registerial designs.   why did we develop master[ed]? the design project what grounded our design decisions for the app? what were the main challenges in designing its interface?  what were the main challenges in designing its user experience? what were the challenges with marketing and business strategies? there were many design challenges involved with creating and refining the user experience (ux) of master[ed], and no doubt many more to come. the main challenge was over designing solutions before running user tests, and more specifically over optimizing certain aspects of the ui. too much too early: it is a very common ux problem to over invest in high fidelity early prototypes. the main challenge we faced was creating new interface iterations without user testing the current interface, leading to overdeveloped solutions that did not address an actual user need. over optimizing: for example, one of the early user tests showed that users were primarily interested in adding short text tags over other available inputs. in response to this we developed many different iterations of the text input system, reducing it to the bare minimum interaction, and attempting to make tagging as fast as possible. however, we did not do any user tests with the interm interface designs to check if the designs were sufficiently optimized. in the end, we found that in the pursuit of optimization we had departed from the register. the new designs were more efficient for existing users, but had become hard to interpret for new users. after testing the new interface, we discovered that although tag speed was important, ease of use for new users was a higher functional context. this discovery could likely have been made earlier in the design process by running ux tests more regularly.   why did we develop master[ed]? the design project what grounded our design decisions for the app? what were the main challenges in designing its interface?  what were the main challenges in designing its user experience? what were the challenges with marketing and business strategies? since master[ed] began as an app designed for use in our own lab, we initially didn't need to test whether there was a market demand for it. in the early phases of the design process we mainly did tests to ensure that master[ed] would be technically feasible. these included short coded tests and research into ios hardware and software capability.  however, when we shifted focus to a public release, we had to reconsider the market desirability and business viability of the application. it was challenging to ensure that we could align all of these considerations. much of the metapatterning advice found in the primer stems from our need to reevaluate the project from end to end.  </slidetext><slidetext slideid="5nvQubasEeN.6oWmhqJjlFd" slidebank="false">why a primer rather than an integration textbook?

why define particular terms? as with master[ed],  the design decisions for the primer were informed by a persona. in this case, the persona was developed out of my relationship with a number of employees at quarry integrated communications in st. jacobs, ontario. i chose to use a professional as my primary persona because there are still more professionals interested in integration than there are students studying integration full-time. additionally, as a persona, the professionals needs were more pragmatic, which helped me get the best practices upfront. in each case, i believe that students will also benefit from these design decisions. click to enlarge  why a primer rather than an integration textbook?

why define particular terms? trifocal principle the central principle represents the fundamental insight that lead to the development of the rest of metapatterning. namely, system, structure, and function are three interrelated perspectives on a unit of consideration, each providing a different but equally useful understanding of how the unit functionally relates to other units. all of the primary principles follow from this concept: the principle of desiderata deals with advice primarily from a functional perspective; the principle of register deals with advice primarily from a structural perspective; and the principle of de copia deals with advice primarily from a system perspective.    why a primer rather than an integration textbook? the primer what grounded my design decisions for the primer? how can ki students and non-specialists benefit from this primer? why is there a central principle? why these primary principles? why these secondary principles? why define particular terms? i went through many different conceptual iterations of the theory of metapatterning, most of which did not separate the principles into a three tiered system. the problem i kept returning to was that until the reader understood the trifocal principle, each of the other principles had to keep going over the trifocal content. once i focused on the trifocal principle as central, the primary principles began to follow from it logically. i chose the principles of desiderata, register and de copia over other potential principles because each bears a clear and express relationship to the three perspectives of the central principle.    why a primer rather than an integration textbook?

the casebook allows me to explain many of the design processes that would otherwise go undiscussed. the process of creating the casebook serves two purposes. first, it forces me to go through a conscious reflection process not only on the creation of master[ed], but also on the primer itself. the exercise ensures that i fully understand the design and integration processes that i employed in my own work. second, it allows me to communicate these processes to other integrators looking to understand more about two integration projects: the mobile application and the integration primer. through the casebook i can share relevant rough work and initial concepts, comment on design work that went on behind the scenes, and expose my method to the benefit of other integrators.     the casebook  how does a casebook help me to reflect on my design practices? why use a q and a structure for a casebook? how does the casebook link my design project to my integration primer? how might other integrators and designers learn from my reflections? how might the casebook expand to cover other disciplines? a q and a structure allows me to reflect and more directly answer the questions that went through my head while creating the primer. it is my hope that these questions represent an authentic collection of questions a reader might have about the design or implementation of master[ed] and the primer.   the casebook  how does a casebook help me to reflect on my design practices?

the casebook reflects on and exposes how the design project informed the integration primer. the process of reflection has been ongoing throughout each project to ensure a renewal of connection between theory and practice. the casebook is primarily an attempt to communicate the background that an integrator would need to more fully understand how each of the three parts of this thesis tie together.   the casebook  how does a casebook help me to reflect on my design practices? why use a q and a structure for a casebook? how does the casebook link my design project to my integration primer? how might other integrators and designers learn from my reflections? how might the casebook expand to cover other disciplines? hopefully by more fully understanding the process of moving from practice to theory and back, other integrators will be able to apply the core principles to disciplines beyond design. it is important that integrators and designers both become reflexive in their respective disciplines. the casebook will provide them with an opportunity to reflect on their own methods and projects.   the casebook  how does a casebook help me to reflect on my design practices?

in the same way that a community of integrators can form around the primer, the casebook structure provides an opportunity for the same community to reflect on their integration processes. in this way, the casebook might expand to include reflections on the process of applying metapatterns to other disciplines.  </slidetext><slidetext slideid="5nvQubasEeN.6ERJh5AJC57" slidebank="false">why is rich media important to this project?

since the design project was primarily a case of visual and interaction design, it was important to present the primer in a way that allow me to speak to the nuances of those designs to more clearly expose their integration processes. the ability to add information points to screen shots is indispensable for explaining the relationship between the principles and the integration examples.   the ebook  why is rich media important to this project? why is interactivity and hyperlinking important? why is it important that the ebook be networked? why did i choose the “storyline” ebook platform? how would i like to see the ebook used in the future? as you can see from the primer persona, it was important for the primer to deliver its advice as quickly and to the point as possible. to ensure this, i have designed the interactivity and hyperlinking in the primer to allow the reader to jump from section to section, to glossary terms and to the internet. this cuts down on the need for the reader to wade through chapters of theory before being able to find or use the practical advice contained within. additionally, it is much easier to see how terms relate when they are directly linked, rather than simply referenced. &lt;a href="metapattern"&gt;metapattern&lt;/a&gt;  the ebook  why is rich media important to this project?

one of the ultimate goals of this thesis is to create a community of interested students and professionals. as such, it is important to distribute the ebook to as many interested individuals as possible. a networked ebook would facilitate the creation of additional content and insights as others share their experiences and reflections.  the ebook  why is rich media important to this project? why is interactivity and hyperlinking important? why is it important that the ebook be networked? why did i choose the “storyline” ebook platform? how would i like to see the ebook used in the future? i chose storyline for a number of reasons. first, it allows for more flexibility than other older articulate products - this became especially important for implementing the glossary. second, other competing products like apple's ibooks still treat ebooks as just digital books. they allow for very little interactivity, focusing primarily on templates and desktop publishing layouts. finally, other products like adobe captivate tend to overcomplicate custom interactions.  the ebook  why is rich media important to this project? why is interactivity and hyperlinking important? why is it important that the ebook be networked? why did i choose the “storyline” ebook platform? how would i like to see the ebook used in the future? i would like to see this ebook serve two main purposes as a tool for professionals from other disciplines to be more integrative in their practice - generating and communicating insights internally or for a client. as a tool for core knowledge integration courses to teach integration theory and analysis. in both cases, i would like to see the ebook as a platform for integrators to communicate best practices, share problems, pose solutions, and advance the integration discipline. </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6JFs1uKYs8P.6Gu8OMVmZPj" slidebank="false">works cited bateson, gregory. mind and nature: a necessary union. toronto: clark, irwin &amp; company 	limited, 1979. print.  brochers, jan. a patterned approach to interaction design. toronto: john wiley &amp; sons, 	1997. print. brown, tim. change by design. new york: harpercollins, 2009. print. erasmus, desiderius. “copia: foundations of the abundant style.” the rhetorical tradition. 	eds. bruce herzberg, patricia bizzell. boston: martin’s press, 1990. 502 - 556. print. giddens, anthony. the constitution of society: outline of the theory of structuration. los 	angeles: university of california press, 1984. print.  kress, gunther r, and theo van leeuwen. reading images: the grammar of visual design. new york: routledge, 2006. print. kuijpers, marinka, and marc coenders.
